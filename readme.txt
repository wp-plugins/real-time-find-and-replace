Set up find and replace rules that are executed AFTER a page is generated by WordPress, but BEFORE it is sent to a user's browser.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to dynamically (i.e. at the time when a page is generated) replace code and text from themes and other plugins with code and text of your choosing before a page is delivered to a user's browser. 

Because the find and replace happens in real-time no changes are needed to plugins or themes which means upgrades remain easy!

Here are some real-world examples:

1. Don't like the "Category:" text that the Dagon Design Sitemap plugin puts in front of every category? Remove it!
2. Annoyed by the link that Global Translator adds to every page? Remove it!
3. Have you noticed that the Sociable plugin doesn't correctly display the Twitter image? No problem, insert it!

And remember, all of the above can be done WITHOUT modifying themes or plugin files so you'll always be able to upgrade them without having to worry about losing custom edits.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the real-time-find-and-replace folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is data stored? =

In an array in the wp_options table. Just one record regardless of the number of find and replace rules.

= Will the find and replace slow my site? =

Unless you're using 50+ rules, you shouldn't notice any performance impact.
